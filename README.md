### Preface
This project is an assignment for our module deliverables (SC2006/CZ2006) and is not intended for any use outside of this scope. 

### Design Principles
In the design of this project, we took into consideration the EAIP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism) Principles in OOP as well as the SOLID principles. 

These principles, in conjuction with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework enabled us to structure our project to achieve loose-coupling and high cohesion. 

The quintessential concepts learnt in this course have proved imperative in the design process of this application.
